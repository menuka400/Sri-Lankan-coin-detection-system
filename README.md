I developed a Coins Deduction System tailored to identify Sri Lankan currency coins using YOLOv8. This system can accurately detect and categorize the following denominations:

💲 Rs.1
💲 Rs.2
💲 Rs.5
💲 Rs.10
💲 Rs.20
💲 Rs.100
💲 Rs.200
💲 Rs.500
💲 Rs.1000
💲 Rs.1500
💲 Rs.2000
💲 Rs.5000
🔍 Key Features:

⏱ Real-time Detection: The system can identify and classify coins in real-time, making it suitable for various automated applications.
💪 Robust Performance: Trained on a diverse set of coin images to ensure reliable detection across different lighting conditions and angles.
🔄 Scalability: The system can be easily adapted to detect other denominations or currencies by retraining the model with a new dataset.

This project showcases my skills in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time object detection, applying them to a practical use case in financial transactions and automation.
